		<p>The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring was founded in 1892 as a Jewish fraternal organization affiliated with the Socialist movement.  The Arbeter Ring is a national organization with local chapters, of which Boston has the most active branch.  Historically, Arbeter Ring ran secular Yiddish schools, a leftist Jewish summer camp, and offered mutual aid benefits to Jewish workers such as life insurance policies and cemeteries.</p>

		<p>Today, the Boston Workmen's Circle is an active center for secular Jewish life and culture in Boston, and hosts many of the Yiddish-language events in the area.  They offer Yiddish classes on four levels every year.</p>
